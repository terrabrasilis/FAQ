      "question":"What is PRODES?",
      "answer":"The PRODES project carries out satellite monitoring of clear-cut deforestation in the Legal Amazon and produces, since 1988, annual deforestation rates in the region, which are used by the Brazilian government to establish public policies. For more information click <a href='http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes' target='_blank'>here</a>."
    },
    {
      "question":"What is DETER?",
      "answer":"DETER is a quick survey of evidence alerts of changes in forest cover in the Amazon, carried out by INPE. DETER was developed as an alert system to support surveillance and deforestation control and forest degradation carried out by the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) and other agencies linked to this theme. For more information click <a href='http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/deter/deter' target='_blank'>here</a>."
    },
    {
      "question":"What is TerraBrasilis?",
      "answer":"The TerraBrasilis portal is a web platform developed by INPE for access, queries, analysis and dissemination of geographic data generated by native vegetation monitoring projects such as PRODES and DETER. Through TerraBrasilis anyone can access the maps and perform analysis on the data directly from the portal, without needing specific tools. For more information click <a href='http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/sobre/' target='_blank'>here</a>."

      "question":"Which panels are available on TerraBrasilis?",
      "answer":"Three panels are available: <a href='http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/app/dashboard/deforestation/biomes/legal_amazon/rates' target='_blank'>Deforestation Dashboard</a> (PRODES), which presents annual rates and deforestation increments in the Legal Amazon and Cerrado; <a href='http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/app/dashboard/alerts/legal/amazon/daily/' target='_blank'>Notice Dashboard</a> (DETER), that shows the forest cover change evidences in the Legal Amazon and Cerrado; and <a href='http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/app/dashboard/fires/legal/amazon/aggregated/' target='_blank'>Active Fires</a>,  that relates the active fires in areas of deforestation and in properties of the CAR in the Amazon biome."
    },
    {
      "question":"Which deforestation data are available on TerraBrasilis?",
      "answer":"Deforestation data are worked on two fronts within the deforestation monitoring program, each with a specific objective. The PRODES program, which makes an annual accounting of what has already been deforested in the previous year and the DETER program, which makes daily notes of signs of deforestation, with less precision, to support the planning of inspection, control and assessment actions promoted by agencies such as <a href='https://www.gov.br/ibama/pt-br' target='_blank'>IBAMA</a>, <a href='https://www.gov.br/icmbio/pt-br' target='_blank'>ICMBio</a>, <a href='https://www.mma.gov.br/' target='_blank'>Ministry of the Environment (MMA)</a>, <a href='http://www.mpf.mp.br/' target='_blank'>Brazilian Federal Public Ministry</a> among others."
    },
    {
      "question":"How often deforestation data are available?",
      "answer":"Deforestation data from the DETER program are available daily and the deforestation data from the PRODES program are available on an annual or biennial basis."
    },
    {
      "question":"In the panel on deforestation statistics, there have been annual rates of deforestation since 1988, but there are no annual increments for these same years, why?",
      "answer":"Annual deforestation rates are values calculated by an algorithm. This process takes into account a series of information including the areas of deforestation measured using satellite images, called increments in deforestation. It happens that the areas of deforestation measured in the initial stages of the PRODES program used technologies very different of the current, generating topologically incompatible data with the new databases. Thus, during the last technological update, it was decided to aggregate all geographic data from 1988 to 2007 in a single layer, rendering impossible annual discrimination. For more details on the technological evolution phases of the PRODES program, click <a href='http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes' target='_blank'>here</a>, and in the <a href='http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes/pdfs/nt_deslocamentomascara.pdf' target='_blank'>technical note</a> (available in Portuguese only)."
    },
    {
      "question":"Is it possible to obtain annual increments of deforestation area previous to 2008 for the Amazon?",
      "answer":"It's not possible. Data for annual increments prior to 2008 are aggregated in a single set, from 1988 to 2007. To learn more about the reasons why this data was aggregated, visit the PRODES page by clicking <a href='http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes' target='_blank'>here</a>."
    },
    {
      "question":"How to obtain the historical series of Amazon deforestation data since 1988?",
      "answer":"Data from the PRODES program for the Legal Amazon are available fully on the <a href='http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/downloads' target='_blank'>download page</a> in shapefile format."
    },
    {
      "question":"What is the difference between deforestation rates and increments of the deforestation area?",
      "answer":"As described on the <a href='http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes' target='_blank'>PRODES</a> page, the rates are estimates calculated from deforestation increments data. Increment is the value measured by the process of visual interpretation of the satellite images available for each fraction of the Amazon, where the fractions are each scene or photo of the satellite that together cover the entire area of interest. For the measured values of annual deforestation increments, the values available for presentation in terrabrasilis are from 2008. This is because the previous data, which are part of the historical series, were produced in a different phase of the PRODES project and with different tools."
    },
    {
      "question":"Why are daily DETER data updated weekly on TerraBrasilis?",
      "answer":"The delay of one week for the release of this data to the public is purposeful, since its primary use is to support the planning of inspection, control and assessment actions promoted by agencies such as <a href='https://www.gov.br/ibama/pt-br' target='_blank'>IBAMA</a>, <a href='https://www.gov.br/icmbio/pt-br' target='_blank'>ICMBio</a>, <a href='https://www.mma.gov.br/' target='_blank'>Ministry of the Environment (MMA)</a>, <a href='http://www.mpf.mp.br/' target='_blank'>Brazilian Federal Public Ministry</a> among others. Access to data with daily update is available through user authentication."
    },
    {
      "question":"Why does the shapefile with data of the DETER program (Amazon) not have data for the period August/2015 to July/2016 if these data are presented on the deforestation notice panel?",
      "answer":"The DETER program was started before this date, August/2015, but it ran on an experimental basis and underwent several changes and interruptions, so we publish data for wide consumption only after stabilization and minimal guarantee of continuity."
    },
    {
      "question":"Does the PRODES project monitor annual deforestation in settlement projects?",
      "answer":"No. The PRODES project does not target settlement projects. The interpretations are based on the limits of the Legal Amazon. Other surveys use the limits of Biomes, such as Cerrado, Pampa and Pantanal. To obtain this data it is necessary to obtain the PRODES data at <a href='http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/downloads' target='_blank'>download page</a> and perform the spatial crossing, intersection, with the polygons of interest, for example the settlement areas."
    },
    {
      "question":"Is it possible to generate deforestation rates by municipality, conservation unit or indigenous lands?",
      "answer":"It's not possible. The maximum cut are the states of the Brazilian Amazon. For these specific cases are used the <a href='http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/app/dashboard/deforestation/biomes/legal_amazon/increments' target='_blank'>increments</a>."
    },
    {
      "question":"Does INPE make individual maps if the user requests it?",
      "answer":"No. INPE cannot meet specific demands from users. But with some knowledge in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the user can manipulate and query on the data available at <a href='http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/downloads' target='_blank'>download page</a>."
    },
    {
      "question":"Are metadata available?",
      "answer":"The metadata of geospatial data available on the TerraBrasilis platform is in the metadata catalog on GeoNetowork.
