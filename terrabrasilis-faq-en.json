          "question": "What is PRODES?",
          "answer": "The PRODES project carries out satellite monitoring of clear-cut deforestation in the Legal Amazon and produces, since 1988, annual deforestation rates in the region, which are used by the Brazilian government to establish public policies. For more information click <a href='http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes' target='_blank'>here</a>."
        },
        {
          "question": "In the deforestation statistics panel there are annual deforestation rates since 1988, but there are no annual increments for these same years. Why?",
          "answer": "Annual deforestation rates are values calculated by an algorithm. This process takes into account several types of information, including areas of deforestation measured using satellite images, called deforestation increments. In the early stages of the PRODES program, deforestation areas were measured using technologies very different from current ones, generating topologically incompatible data. Therefore, during the last technological update, it was decided to aggregate all geographic data from 1988 to 2007 into a single layer, making annual discrimination impossible. For more details on the technological evolution of the PRODES program, click <a href='http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes' target='_blank'>here</a> and see this <a href='http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes/pdfs/nt_deslocamentomascara.pdf' target='_blank'>technical note</a>."

        {
          "question": "Is it possible to obtain annual deforestation area increments prior to 2008 for the Amazon?",
          "answer": "It is not possible. Annual increments prior to 2008 are aggregated into a single dataset, from 1988 to 2007. To learn more about the reasons for this aggregation, visit the PRODES page by clicking <a href='http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes' target='_blank'>here</a>."

          "question": "How can I obtain the historical series of deforestation data in the Amazon since 1988?",
          "answer": "Data from the PRODES program for the Legal Amazon are fully available on the <a href='http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/downloads' target='_blank'>download page</a> in shapefile format."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between deforestation rates and deforestation area increments?",
          "answer": "As described on the <a href='http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes' target='_blank'>PRODES</a> page, rates are estimates calculated from deforestation increment data. Increment is the value measured through visual interpretation of satellite images available for each fraction of the Amazon. Annual increment values available on TerraBrasilis start from 2008."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does the PRODES project monitor annual deforestation in settlement projects?",
          "answer": "No. The PRODES project does not target settlement projects. Interpretations are based on the limits of the Legal Amazon. To obtain such data, spatial intersection with polygons of interest must be performed."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it possible to generate deforestation rates by municipality, conservation unit or indigenous lands?",
          "answer": "It is not possible. The maximum available breakdown is by states of the Legal Amazon. For these specific cases, deforestation increments are used."

        {
          "question": "Why are daily DETER data updated weekly on TerraBrasilis?",
          "answer": "The one-week delay in releasing data is intentional, as its primary use is to support inspection actions by environmental agencies. Daily access is available through authentication."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why does the DETER shapefile not contain data for the period from August/2015 to July/2016?",
          "answer": "The DETER program operated on an experimental basis before August/2015 and underwent several changes and interruptions. Consolidated data were only published after stabilization."
